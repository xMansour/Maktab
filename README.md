## How It Works<a id='howItWorks'></a>
This software takes the fields that change from one contract to another from the user and updates them automatically in the type of contract selected by the user.  

If you opt to utilize the source code, you must have a Data folder in the parent directory. To use the Jar file located in the target location, you must include the Data folder. For the sake of confidentiality, the Data folder was excluded from this repository.
